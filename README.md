  Covid-19 Data Fetch (Advanced useEffect)
</p>

## ❓ Notes

This repository builds on the code from the second session of the workshop. Here, we use the dependency array of the useEffect hook to call the API multiple times based on a button click. You can view the code for a beefed up Covid-19 data fetch example website [here](https://github.com/leonardtng/fancy-covid-data), and a live demo of it can be found [here](http://fancy-covid-data.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/)
